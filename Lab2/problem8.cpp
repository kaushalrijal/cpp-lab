/*
A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage charges an additional
$0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. People who park their cars for longer
than 24 hours will pay $8.00 per day. Write a program that calculates and prints the parking charges. The inputs
to your program are the date and time when a car enters the parking garage, and the dateand time when the same car
leaves the parking garage. Keep track of number of cars in the garage overloading ++ and -- operators.
